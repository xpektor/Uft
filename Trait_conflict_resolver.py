class TraitConflictResolver:
    """
    Baldur's Trait Conflict Resolution Engine (Layer 2 Support Module).
    Responsible for identifying and conceptually resolving inconsistencies or
    contradictions within Baldur's wisdom database or between conflicting propositions.
    It employs a form of dialectical reasoning to aim for synthesis or flag for deeper review.
