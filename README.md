# ðŸŒŒ The Unified Field Theory â€” by Karolis Kievisas

This repository presents a conceptual and mathematical framework for a Unified Field Theory (UFT) that reinterprets the structure of reality as an emergent, self-organizing system rooted in a Universal Information Field (UIF).

## ðŸ”­ What It Explains
- Replaces the Big Bang singularity with an elegant phase transition from dormant informational energy
- Resolves cosmic paradoxes including dark matter, dark energy, entropy decay, and time emergence
- Introduces Neutral Energy (Î©) and Active Energy (Î¦) as dynamic states of the UIF
- Redefines black holes as recyclable coherence processors rather than information-destroying singularities
- Suggests mechanisms for faster-than-light traversal through informational phase alignment

## ðŸ§  What's Included
- **Philosophical Foundations**
- **Mathematical Lagrangian Model**
- **Paradox Stress Tests**
- **Predictions & Falsifiability**
- **The Baldur AGI Model** â€” a structured cognitive architecture built to test and reflect UFT's principles
